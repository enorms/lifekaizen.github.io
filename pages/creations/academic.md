# Code snippets

- [Birthday problem][1]\* - In probability and statistics class we were studying various problems in probability. The demo for this one was broken, but I still wanted to play with the concept, so I bluit this quickly and shared it with the class.
- [Recursion in python][2] - building off the basic idea presented in class, added error handling and cleaned up and shortened the code a bit and added example cases
- [Shipping cost calculator][3] - This was for a paid beta that would assist with shipping operations at a warehouse. this was the first large API work that I wrote. To find the lowest cost shipping, it pulls data from several sources then runs some internal loops to apply constraints. (It's very functional as I had not yet learned any object oriented concepts.)

\* _It's more likely that a group of n people share a(t least one) birthday than is typically intuitive._
