_Describing the image_[^1]

###### Footnotes:

The problem with an airline example is people will think of greenhouse gases, how takeoff & landing are where the accidents happen, and the time delay from a layover - at least I would. We have to imagine a theoretical world where all flights had one extra seat that would have gone empty, you have no luggage, and are so engrossed in [a book] for the next 12 hours that you don't care where you are or what you are doing. We could think of a simpler example, but as physicists like to ignore gravity, let us try to ignore these other things to get to the point. So it costs less, is that good?
