# Background 

Running a startup, I would often recieve official notices of filings due or information needed, often these had large fees and specific procedures to follow. They always seemed to come from nowhere and with the pace and endless tasks of a high-velocity startup it is hard to find the time to closely research and respond. This is an attempt to ease the burden for other founders.

This is intended for venture-backed startup companies who have already decided to use a Delaware C-Corp, which is the standard for venture-backed startup companies (there are many great resources about making that decision and I won't get into it here). In addition to Delaware, the company will also need to register and remain compliant in any state the company conducts business.
