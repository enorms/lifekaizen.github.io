# Investing

## An attempt to explain recent developments in this hobby that lately pays the rent

Here is the cumulative return from approximately 2017 to August 2021. My return is 510% which seems to be better than the standard indexes, and even some hedge funds. For example, the S&P 500 index was up 103%, so I did better by approximately 400%. This was kind of unexpected and we'll see if it can continue. It's also not outrageous in this time where people made thousands of percent just with Bitcoin.

I've been interested in economics and business since I was a teenager, the way I imagine the poster American boy reads about baseball players and memorizes their stats, I would do for businesses.[^1] I thought in college I might go to Wall Street, so I was doing some investing or trading even then.[^2] However, it was fairly recently, using much that I learned in the startup world, that I began to think I had figured (some) things out.

_Annual returns, compared to benchmark, and differential over (under)_

Starting in 2017, I beat the S&P 500 every year. Even in the down year of 2018, though not by much in 2019, and there were shorter periods where the index was doing better.[^3] I include 2016 to make as a data point that something did change around the end of 2016. Cumulatively during this period, the return was 477% vs SP500 115%.[^4]

So 2020 was very good.[^5] Having lived through the 2007 financial crisis, when it felt like the economic world might end, 2020 felt quite different. A terrible humanitarian and social crisis, the economic situation in the US was overall sound and the pandemic appeared temporary because we know what viruses are and how to make vaccines. I expected temporary to be about 2 years, but it turned out to be closer to a year for the stock market, and about 1.5 years for the US (still going elsewhere).

I began buying early and rationed my buying to small amounts. That was good because I started well before the bottom(s), but it also mean I did buy on the bottom, and as far as I know, out of everyone I knew, I was the only person buying stocks then. I took on a margin position for a short time which amplified the return. 2020 return was 114 % vs 16 % for the S&P 500.

On the other hand, near the end of the year with the stock market a bit too high, Biden came in and more money and debt was added to the system (trillions), I missed that the economy/market would rotate into different sectors, and that inflation fears would spike Bitcoin 5x. But you can't see everything. Despite volatility and reduction in early 2021, now in July YTD gain is 25 % vs. SP500 17%.

At some point in 2020, related to explaining options to a room mate who had a Robinhood account, I began a new strategy. Really this happened with the Gamestop frenzy. I was fascinated, and looking at the options it seemed to me the model had broken. The increase in stock price was so fast, and so great, that the implied volatility exploded (increasing the value a standard model would give). On top of that, people seemed to think it would go further and were pushing up prices even more. It seemed to me that this was not random volatility, this was directional (up). It also seemed that while there might be great craziness around the stock, there could be some safety well under the current price - as in it might go from 300 to 250, but not to 25. I pictured a whale swimming along under the ocean, oblivious to some giant tsunami passing overhead. In my spread sheet, I was seeing annual return so high - 413%, 1434%, 871%, etc. - I thought there must be an error in the formula.

_GME rocketing, starting to fall back to earth, and settling higher_[^10]

I made $28,331 the first week. $11,342 the second, and another $48,479 before (some) sanity returned. In fact in the third week, I tried going the other way thinking too early that the craziness was over, but when I realized this I took a $4k loss to switch directions again - (sometimes you just have to accept that) you can't fight the market.

So that kicked off a strategy that seems to be working for me. I sell out of the money puts and if they expire with no value I keep the premium. The professional term is short theta, the decay of time value as the option approaches expiration.[^9] One way to think about it is like providing insurance, if prices crashed the other party could sell their stock to me at a higher price, so they pay me a little bit for this guarantee. Like an insurance premium, if there is no claim the insurer keeps the premium.[^6] This has worked quite well with $345k gains in the first 6.5 months of 2021.[^7][^8]

There are a few specific strategies related to this. Just to name them, there is the consumer version of the Warren Buffet long bets which try to be a binary play on whether a company will be greatly permanently impaired (i.e. go bankrupt), pricing anomalies, special situations around acquisitions, and what we can call other. Another time I'll go into more detail about these.

###### Footnotes:

[^1]: At that time I was not aware of the various inequalities in our society. There was also less (visible) inequality than now, though I'm sure there was a lot, less multi-million dollar golden parachutes, billionaires, etc. Well, the 80s was summed up in Wall Street's "Greed is good", so perhaps I was just naive.
[^2]: There was a culture clash, I find the Silicon Valley creative style is a better fit for me. I don't enjoy the one round negotiation type relationships.
[^3]: Not taking into account risk considerations here; this is just straight return.
[^4]: Jan 2017 to July 2021.
[^5]: Financially only! It was a terrible health crisis with much unnecessary suffering, which exposed great problems in the US. I was extremely lucky to have some control over my situation and if by some magic I could undo everything I would, but I can't so who does it help for me to _not_ do my investment hobby. I donated over $4,000 focused on basic care like food, and social justice. This year I donated $10,000 focused on helping black owned businesses. That's not a lot in the scheme of things, but it's not nothing either.
[^6]: Though it's not as bad the other way, because instead of buying them a new home that was burned down by fire, it's something more like getting a Van Gogh painting because the auction sale price was too low - it's still a Van Gogh. (I will have to work on this part of the metaphor.)
[^7]: Total realized and unrealized; realized is $228k.
[^8]: Includes Gamestop.
[^9]: <https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta>
[^10]: One of my favorite parts of the Gamestop saga was when Congress called everyone to testify, and assuming the Reddit meme leader RoaringKitty had been running a pump-and-dump scheme, where a message board talks up a worthless stock so the talkers can dump it all for a profit, so they ask him how much he made: he taps the mike, looks around slowly, then looks straight at the Chairperson - "Didn't sell a share" he replies. Which pretty much ended his part of the testimony. (Highly embellished)

[11]: Overall note: returns based on Performance calculated by Interactive Brokers. Does take into account cash flows and only looks at returns, not changes in account value. Over the time period I have had accounts elsewhere (for example now about 12% are elsewhere), I expect it is close enough to be a good proxy. This is the only account where options trading occurs, and for the most part any trading. Elsewhere, and even in the far majority of this account, I try to pick well and hold. That seems to be where the big gains come from, it's less time and energy (debatable), and feels more like an owner doing something useful for the world with capital.
